# Counts format 1.0

A counts file records what a device measured when it ran a set of circuits. The counts file binds
the run to the profile that the circuits were planned from. The file also binds the run to the
physical qubits that the circuits ran on and to the exact ops that the device executed.
`nv compare` scores a profile on a counts file.

NoiseVault reads a counts file with `load_counts(path)` from `noisevault.counts`. A file may be
gzip-compressed (`.json.gz`). `plan(profile)` gives the circuits to run, and
`simulate(profile, circuits, shots=..., seed=...)` draws counts for them from a profile.

## An example

The example shows a hypothetical run of two circuits on three qubits of ibm_kingston. The example
uses invented counts to show the format.

```

Circuit qubit i of a circuit is `qubits[i]`, so `ghz_chain` runs on qubits 148, 149 and 150. Ops
name circuit qubits. The `cz` gate takes 68 ns on these qubits, so qubit 150 waits 68 ns for the
first `cz`. Qubit 148 idles 68 ns while the second `cz` runs. Each wait is a `delay` op. After the
last op, the device measures each circuit qubit i into classical bit i. With
`"bit_order": "qiskit"`, the rightmost character of a counts key is classical bit 0, so `"100"`
means that qubit 150 read 1.

## Top-level fields

`load_counts` requires every field.

| Field | Content |
| --- | --- |
| `nv_counts` | The format version, `"1.0"`. |
| `source` | `hardware`, or `simulated` for counts drawn from a profile. |
| `profile` | The `id` and the calibration `fingerprint` of the profile the circuits were planned from. |
| `backend` | The device that ran the circuits, as the profile's `device.name` spells it. |
| `run_at` | When the device started the first circuit, an ISO 8601 time with a timezone. Stored in UTC. |
| `bit_order` | How the counts keys order the classical bits, `qiskit` or `clbit0_left`. |
| `execution` | How the device ran the circuits. |
| `circuits` | The circuits, at least one, each with its ops and counts. |

Unknown keys are errors everywhere except inside `execution.options`. Values are strict. A count
of `"4000"` or `4000.0`, or a flag of `1`, is an error rather than a coercion.

`profile.fingerprint` is the fingerprint of the planning profile without `unmodeled_error`, as 64
hex digits. In Python, the value is `profile.calibration_fingerprint`, the fingerprint of
`profile.uncorrected()`. `nv compare` scores the counts only against a profile with this
calibration fingerprint and this `backend`.

## Execution

Format 1.0 accepts only a run of exactly the listed ops, where each shot starts from a fresh
ground state. Each flag must have the value that starts its row, and `load_counts` refuses a file
with the other value.

| Field | Content |
| --- | --- |
| `client` | The software that ran the circuits, such as `"qiskit-ibm-runtime 0.49.0 SamplerV2, qiskit 2.5.2"`. |
| `transpiled` | `false`. A transpiled run may have executed other ops than the listed ones. |
| `gate_twirling` | `false`. Gate twirling adds random Pauli gates that the ops do not list. |
| `measure_twirling` | `false`. Measurement twirling flips qubits at random before the measurement. The random flips change the readout error. |
| `dynamical_decoupling` | `false`. Dynamical decoupling adds pulses on idle qubits that the ops do not list. |
| `init_qubits` | `true`. Without `init_qubits`, a shot may start where the previous shot ended, not from 0. |
| `job_ids` | The ids of the jobs that ran the circuits. Optional, default `[]`. |
| `options` | The run's submission options, as a JSON object nested at most 64 levels deep. `options` itself is level 1. Optional, default `{}`. |

When `options` holds one of these Qiskit Runtime `SamplerV2` options, the option must have the
value shown, or `load_counts` refuses the file:

| Option | Required value |
| --- | --- |
| `twirling.enable_gates` | `false` |
| `twirling.enable_measure` | `false` |
| `dynamical_decoupling.enable` | `false` |
| `execution.init_qubits` | `true` |
| `execution.meas_type` | `"classified"` |

The required values are the `SamplerV2` defaults in qiskit-ibm-runtime 0.40 and 0.49, so a run
with the default options passes. `SAMPLER_V2_OPTIONS` in `noisevault.counts` holds this table as a
mapping from each option's path to its required value.

A job id links to the IBM Quantum account that ran the job. Therefore, share a counts file only
where you would share its job ids. NoiseVault reads counts files from your disk and never uploads
them. A profile fitted with `nv compare` stores the SHA-256 of the counts file, not the counts or
the job ids.

## Circuits

| Field | Content |
| --- | --- |
| `name` | The circuit's name. Names are unique within a file. |
| `qubits` | The physical qubits, 1 to 10 and distinct. Circuit qubit i is `qubits[i]`. |
| `ops` | The ops the device ran, in order, on circuit qubits. Can be empty. |
| `shots` | The number of shots, at least 1 and at most 10^10 (10000000000). |
| `counts` | The number of shots that gave each outcome. The counts add up to `shots`. |

The device measures every circuit qubit once, after the last op, into the classical bit with the
same index. A file holds at most 4096 outcomes over all its circuits, where a circuit on n qubits
has 2^n. `simulate` also refuses `shots` above 10^10.

### Ops

An op is `[name, [circuit qubits], [parameters]]`, as `nv check --json` writes it, such as
`["rz", [0], [1.5708]]`. The name is `delay`, or a gate in the
[gate registry](profile-format.md#gates) that has a unitary. A gate acts on as many distinct
qubits as the registry says. Its parameters are the registry's, as finite numbers in radians.

`["delay", [q], [ns]]` idles circuit qubit q for ns nanoseconds, 0 or more. A delay idles one
qubit. `measure` and `reset` are not ops.

### Counts keys

A key has one character, `0` or `1`, per circuit qubit. `bit_order` says which end holds
classical bit 0:

| `bit_order` | Classical bit 0 | Key for "circuit qubit 0 read 1, qubit 1 read 0" |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `qiskit` | The rightmost character, as Qiskit prints counts. | `"01"` |
| `clbit0_left` | The leftmost character. | `"10"` |

`load_counts` stores keys as `clbit0_left`, sorted, with zero counts dropped. `circuit.vector()`
gives the counts as an array in the order of the reference simulator's probabilities, with
circuit qubit 0 as the most significant bit.

## Planned circuits

`plan(profile)` returns the circuits `nv check` runs, on the qubits `nv check` picks.
`plan(profile, layout)` uses the qubits of `layout` instead, as `profile.check(layout=...)` does.
`plan` schedules each gate as soon as its qubits are free, using the gate durations the profile
states, and writes every wait as a `delay`. It also pads each qubit with a delay to the end of the
circuit. No qubit then has a gap that the ops do not fill, so any scheduling policy on the device
gives the same timeline. A gate with no stated duration, such as a virtual `rz`, takes 0 ns. A
profile with `unmodeled_error` plans the same circuits as its calibration.

```python
import noisevault as nv
from noisevault.counts import load_counts, plan, simulate

kingston = nv.load("ibm_kingston@2026-04-15")
circuits = plan(kingston)
counts = simulate(kingston, circuits, shots=4000, seed=1)
counts.save("kingston.counts.json")

print([c.name for c in circuits])
print(load_counts("kingston.counts.json") == counts)
# ['ghz_chain', 'mirror', 'single_qubit', 'readout']
# True
```

`simulate` draws the counts from the reference simulator, with the profile's unmodeled-error
factors applied. It binds the counts to the profile's calibration fingerprint and sets `source` to
`simulated`. `run_at` defaults to the current UTC time. The same `seed` and `run_at` give the same
file. The reference simulator does not model effects. It leaves out an effect with `allow` set to
`omit`, and it refuses a profile with an effect that sets any other `allow` value.

## Counts from an IBM device

`scripts/run_on_ibm.py` runs the planned circuits on an IBM device through your IBM Quantum
account. It writes a counts file bound to the calibration in effect when the job ran. The script
also does the following:

- It sets `experimental.execution.scheduler_timing` to `true` in `execution.options`. This option
  asks IBM to return how it scheduled each circuit.
- When IBM returns a schedule, the script writes the schedule to `<stem>.timing.json` beside the
  counts file. The timing file has an entry for each circuit that IBM returned a schedule for.
- If your catalog does not have the calibration that the counts bind to, the script saves that
  calibration to `<stem>.profile.json` beside the counts file. The `nv compare` command that the
  script prints then names this file.
- It saves the submitted job to `<stem>.job.json` beside the counts file. The script deletes the
  job file after it saves the counts. If the wait for the job stops, run the same command
  again.
  The script then collects that job instead of submitting another.

`<stem>` is the counts file name without `.counts.json`. For `kingston-0416.counts.json`, the
files are `kingston-0416.timing.json`, `kingston-0416.profile.json` and `kingston-0416.job.json`.

### The script never replaces a file

The script never replaces a file that it did not write. This rule applies to the counts file and
to the `.timing.json`, `.profile.json` and `.job.json` files beside it.

- Before the script opens your account, it checks the counts, timing and profile files. If one of
  them exists, the script stops. Give `-o` a new file name.
- Before the script submits the job, it creates the job file and writes the planned circuits
  into it. If the job file exists at that time, the script stops and submits nothing. A second
  run of the same command can create the job file while the first run waits for your answer.
- After IBM accepts the job, the script adds the job id to the job file. Before and after it adds
  the job id, the script checks that the job file is still the file that it created. The file
  must also still hold the bytes that the script wrote. If another program replaced, moved or
  deleted the job file, or changed it in place, the script does not change that file. The script
  saves the job to a new job file and stops. See
  [If the script cannot save the job id](#if-the-script-cannot-save-the-job-id).
- After the job runs, the script writes the counts, timing and profile files together. If
  another program created or replaced one of them before the script finished, the script keeps
  none of its own files. It keeps the other program's file and the job file.
- The script deletes a job file only if that file is still the job file that it read or created.
  The file must also still hold the bytes that the script read or wrote. If another run saved a
  new job file at the same path or changed the job file in place, the script keeps that file.
- If the script cannot delete the job file after it saves the counts, it prints a warning. Then
  it prints the saved files and the `nv compare` command. You can delete the job file yourself.

To collect a job to a new counts file, give `--collect` the job file. Then give `-o` a new file
name. For example, run the same command with
`--collect kingston-0416.job.json -o kingston-0416b.counts.json`. The script collects that job and
does not submit another. You can also move the other program's file to a different path. Then run
the same command again.

The script checks for the job file before it opens your account. If the job file exists at that
time, the script collects the job that the file records. The script also collects a job when you
give `--collect` or `--job-id`. When the script collects a job, it never submits a job. If the
script cannot read the job file, or the job file is gone when the script reads it, the script
stops with an error. If a value in the job file is not valid, the script stops before it opens the
job. If the script can read a job id in the damaged file, the hint names that job. The script
cannot collect that job, so find it in your IBM Quantum account.

### If the script cannot save the job id

IBM gives the job id after the script submits the job. If the script cannot add the job id to the
job file, the script stops. The error names the job id, and the hint gives the command that
collects the job:

```text
error: could not save job d1h9q8k5x4w0008r7t2g to kingston-0416.job.json ([Errno 28] No space left on device)
hint: run the same command with --job-id d1h9q8k5x4w0008r7t2g to collect the job
```

The job file keeps the planned circuits. Make space on the disk, then run the command in the
hint. The script collects that job and does not submit another.

In two cases, the script saves the planned circuits and the job id to a new job file,
`<stem>.<job id>.job.json`:

- Another program replaced, moved or deleted the job file, or changed it in place, while the
  script submitted the job or added the job id.
- A failed write left a part of the job id in the job file, and the script could not remove that
  part.

The script creates this file only if no file has that name. The hint gives the command that
collects the job:

```text
error: kingston-0416.job.json changed while the script submitted job d1h9q8k5x4w0008r7t2g. The script saved job d1h9q8k5x4w0008r7t2g to kingston-0416.d1h9q8k5x4w0008r7t2g.job.json
hint: run the same command with --collect=kingston-0416.d1h9q8k5x4w0008r7t2g.job.json to collect the job
```

If the script cannot save that file either, the error names the job id. Find the job in your IBM
Quantum account.

### Errors from IBM

If a request to IBM fails while the script opens the device, the script stops before it submits
a job. The error names the device and the reason:

```text
error: could not open ibm_kingston through your IBM Quantum account ('network is unreachable')
hint: run the same command again. The script did not submit a job
```

## SHA-256 and canonical form

`counts.sha256` is `sha256:` plus the SHA-256 of the canonical JSON (sorted keys, no whitespace)
of the loaded file. The loaded file has its keys in one order, with zero counts dropped. The
same run therefore has one SHA-256, whether its file says `qiskit` or `clbit0_left`.
`counts.save(path)` writes readable JSON of the loaded form, so the same run always gives the
same bytes.

## Errors

`load_counts` raises `nv.CountsError`, a `ValueError`, for a file it refuses. The message is one
line that starts with the path and names the field, such as
`run.counts.json: circuits[0]: counts sum to 3999, but shots is 4000`. `hint` says how to fix the
problem. A key that occurs two times in one JSON object is an error, such as two `"0"` keys in
`counts`. `load_counts` raises `OSError` for a file that it cannot read.
